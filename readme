* goals with visibility of elements *
- is element visible in the current viewport?
- is element visible if user scrolls? (eg if the screen was big enough, would the element be visible?)

- element is on the top or left of the browser (not scrollable)
- element's CSS is not visible
- border lines: half of the box is showing ... how much should be showing to make it be OK?

- each test has red box around the relevant area when found.
